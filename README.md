# Vinay's Bot 1.0 🚀

Hey! This is my first AI chatbot project. I built this because I wanted to create a sleek, fast assistant that looks great and actually works. I used Gemini 3 Flash for the brains and spent a lot of time on the CSS to give it a clean "Glassmorphism" look.

> "Keep your ego aside & approach to me ASAP"

## What I built
* **Real AI Power**: I hooked this up to Google's Gemini API (v1beta) so it can actually handle smart conversations.
* **Clean Design**: I didn't want a boring chat box. I made a floating UI with smooth animations and a custom "Jakarta Sans" font.
* **Branded Welcome**: When you open the bot, you'll see my custom welcome screen. It stays there until you send your first message.
* **No Ugly Errors**: If you hit the API limit, the bot tells you in a friendly way instead of crashing with a long link.

---

## The Tech I Used
* **Frontend**: Just HTML5 and CSS3 (no heavy frameworks).
* **Logic**: Vanilla JavaScript for the API calls and DOM stuff.
* **AI Model**: `gemini-3-flash-preview`.

## How to use it yourself

1. **Clone it**:
   `git clone https://github.com/vinay33333/vinays-bot.git`
2. **Add your key**:
   Open up `script.js` and paste your own Gemini API key into the `API_KEY` variable.
3. **Run it**:
   Just open `index.html` in your browser and you're good to go.

## Heads up!
Since I'm using the free tier, there's a limit of **20 messages per minute**. If the bot tells you to "cool down," just give it a minute and try again. Also, be careful with your API key—don't share it!
